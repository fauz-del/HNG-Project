        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! I’m <strong>Agbalaya Fauzeeyat</strong>, a dedicated frontend developer
          passionate about designing clean, responsive, and interactive web pages.
          My journey into tech started about a year ago, driven by curiosity and the love
          for solving creative challenges through code. I enjoy turning ideas into
          beautiful and functional user experiences that make an impact.

      <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          My current focus is mastering frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while strengthening my understanding of responsive design and accessibility. In the near future, I aim to move into backend development with Node.js, Python, and SQL eventually becoming a skilled full-stack developer capable of building end-to-end solutions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build and deploy more real-world projects.</li>
          <li>Collaborate with other developers to improve teamwork and code quality.</li>
          <li>Contribute to open-source projects and technical communities.</li>
        </ul>

      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
        <p>
          I’m still developing confidence in debugging and optimizing complex JavaScript logic. However, I treat every challenge as a learning opportunity and constantly improve through consistent practice and community feedback.

        <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>

          Keep learning, keep building, and never lose the curiosity that started this journey. Every step no matter how small is progress toward your dream career.

      <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I’m a huge anime and fantasy novel fan. I love stories that explore creativity resilience, and growth values that also guide me in my developer journey. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading, sketching ideas for a new project, or learning something new about tech.
